CSS -- cascading stylesheets. Control all properties of HTML objects
Examples: colors, positions, size, and beyond.

A css rule is made up of the selector, then an open curly brace, followed by
a list of rules you'd like to apply with a semi-colon at the end of each 
rule, and then a closing curly brace. Like this:

p {
   padding: 20px;
   font-size: 14pt;
}

In CSS, you must "select" which object you want to apply a set of rules to.
There are three typical kinds of "selectors":
  * Select by the tag name
  * Select by the class
  * Select by the unique ID

Example:

<h2 class="sub-heading" id="hobbies">My Hobbies</h2>
 |          |                ^---- #hobbies {}
 |          ^------- .sub-heading {}
 ^----- h2 {}

 There are also ways to be more "specific" in your selectors:
   * p em {} -- Decendent (All <em> inside a <p>)
   * p > a {} -- Child Of (All <a> tags that are immediate children of <p>)

 There are also a few extra "psuedo" classes, like
   * :hover -- activates only when an object is hovered
   * :visited :active -- unique to the <a> tag
   * :nth-child(1), :last-child, :first-child -- more advanced selectors
         that enable you to select a unique object in a list, for example
         to make the last table row have a unique background color.

Each element has both unique and common css values. Some common ones are:
   * color (typically text color)
   * background-color (and background-image, background-size, etc.)
   * font-size, font-family, font-weight
   * width, height
   * position, display
   * Many more https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference

There are several units available too, both legacy and modern. Examples:
   * px -- pixels (1/96th of 1in)
   * pt -- points (1/72 of 1in)
   * em -- Relative to font-size of the element (2em = 2x current font-size)
   * % -- percent
   * vh, vw -- relative to 1% of height/width of viewport
   * A few others too that are used less often

There are three ways to link up your css to your html:
   * External link with a <link> tag in the <head> of your document (recommended)
   * Embedded in <style> tags within the <head> of your document
   * Inline in the style="" attribute of individual tags.

External is best because you can keep cleare separation, and reuse css over
multiple files.
<head>
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>

Embedded works if you know you'll only have a single html file.
<head>
   <style type="text/css">
      p {
         color: red;
         border: 1px solid black;
      }
   </style>
</head>

Inline is the "easy way", but always ends in maintenance issues because it 
can be hard to track down changes.
<p style="color: red; border: 1px solid black">Text</p>
